ðŸ“„ Project Description
Cat Loaf Rater is a web-based application that allows users to upload an image of their cat and receive a scientifically ridiculous "Loaf Score" â€” a percentage indicating how much their cat resembles a perfectly formed bread loaf.
Behind the scenes, LoafMeter analyzes the cat image using simple visual heuristics like aspect ratio, area ratio, symmetry ratio, and posture alignment of the cat uploaded.


The Problem (That Doesnâ€™t Exist)
People lack a reliable, standardized way to measure how loafy their cats are. The current system (eyeballing and emotional bias) is flawed and inconsistent. It's a serious gap in the world of cat-based nonsense.

ðŸ’¡ The Solution (That Nobody Asked For)
 Cat Loaf Rater solves this entirely imaginary crisis by introducing an image analysis pipeline that:

-> totally believable and emotionally satisfying "Loaf Score" out of 100

-> Calculates aspect ratio (length vs. height)

-> Estimates loafy posture by bounding box shape

-> Checks symmetry ratio (left vs. right cat sides)

-> Evaluates area coverage ratio
