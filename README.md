## Project Description

**Cat Loaf Rater** is a web-based application that allows users to upload an image of their cat and receive a scientifically ridiculous "Loaf Score" ‚Äî a percentage indicating how much their cat resembles a perfectly formed bread loaf.
LoafMeter analyzes the cat image using basic visual heuristics like aspect ratio, area ratio, symmetry ratio, and posture alignment.

---

## The Problem (that doesn't exist)

People lack a reliable, standardized way to measure how loafy their cats are.
The current system‚Äîeyeballing and emotional bias‚Äîis flawed and inconsistent.
This has left a gaping hole in the world of cat-based nonsense.

---

## The Solution (that nobody asked for)

Cat Loaf Rater heroically tackles this entirely imaginary crisis using an overengineered image analysis pipeline that:

* Returns a **totally believable and emotionally satisfying Loaf Score** out of 100
* Calculates **aspect ratio** (length vs. height)
* Estimates **loafy posture** based on bounding box shape
* Checks **symmetry ratio** (left vs. right sides)
* Evaluates **area coverage ratio**

All for absolutely no real-world gain!
